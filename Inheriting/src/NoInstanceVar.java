		// here is an implicit call to super() with no arguments for all classes that have a parent - 
		// which is every user defined class in Java - so calling it explicitly is usually not required. 
		// However, you may use the call to super() with arguments if the parent's constructor takes 
		// parameters, and you wish to specify them. Moreover, if the parent's constructor takes parameters, 
		// and it has no default parameter-less constructor, you will need to call super() with argument(s).

		// An example, where the explicit call to super() gives you some extra control over the title of the
		// num += 1; //instance var num is still passed down
